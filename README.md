# Wine_Quality
A project to determine if the quality of wine can be ascertained by predictor variables. This was done by using maching learning to get predictor values.

This project was developed in cooperation with Teresa Miller.(https://github.com/Teresawithoutah)

## Description of the Data Set
Through the UCI ML Repository,* we selected a dataset detailing red vinho (wine) samples from the north of Portugal.

The datasets contained 12 attributes based on physicochemical tests ranging from:

fixed acidity volatile acidity citric acid residual sugar chlorides free sulfur dioxide total sulfur dioxide density pH Sulphates alcohol level quality
